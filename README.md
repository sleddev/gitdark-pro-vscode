# GitDark Pro VSCode Theme

This theme is a mashup of the syntax highlighting of [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/one-dark/vscode-one-dark-pro) and the UI colors of the [GitHub Dark](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme) red/green colorblind theme.

## Install

1. Go to [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sleddev.gitdark-pro).
2. Click on the "Install" button.
3. Then [select the theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_selecting-the-color-theme).

## Override this theme

To override this (or any other) theme in your personal config file, please follow the guide in the [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) documentation. This is handy for small tweaks to the theme without having to fork and maintain your own theme.
